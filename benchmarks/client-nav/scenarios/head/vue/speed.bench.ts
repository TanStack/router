  /**
   * Running `vitest bench` ignores "suite hooks" like `beforeAll` and `afterAll`,
   * so we use tinybench's `setup` and `teardown` options to run our setup and teardown logic.
   *
   * But CodSpeed calls the benchmarked function directly, bypassing `setup` and `teardown`,
   * but it does support `beforeAll` and `afterAll`.
   *
   * So it looks like we're setting up in duplicate, but in reality, it's only running once per environment, as intended.
