# Client Navigation Benchmarks

Cross-framework client-side CPU benchmarks for:

- `@tanstack/react-router`
- `@tanstack/solid-router`
- `@tanstack/vue-router`

The benchmarks run in jsdom against production builds of real apps, and are
tracked in CI by CodSpeed (simulation mode).

> **Scope:** these benchmarks cover the standalone client router only. The
> client side of TanStack Start (hydration of a server-rendered document,
> streamed payload consumption, server-function calls from the client, ...) is
> not covered here; the server side of Start is covered by `benchmarks/ssr`.

## Layout

- `react/`, `solid/`, `vue/` - baseline benchmark (mixed navigation loop) + Vitest config
- `vitest.react.config.ts`, `vitest.solid.config.ts`, `vitest.vue.config.ts` - per-framework aggregate configs that run the baseline first, then scenario projects
- `scenarios/harness.ts` - shared scenario runner (mount, link-click steps, `onRendered` synchronization)
- `scenarios/<scenario>/shared.ts` - framework-agnostic scenario definition (workload data, step sequence, assertions, bench options)
- `scenarios/<scenario>/<framework>/` - isolated scenario apps

Scenario app layout:

```text
scenarios/<scenario>/<framework>/
  vite.config.ts
  speed.bench.ts
  speed.flame.ts
  setup.ts
  project.json
  tsconfig.json
  src/
    main.tsx
    routeTree.gen.ts
    routes/
```

Scenario apps use file-based routing (`@tanstack/router-plugin`) with a
generated `routeTree.gen.ts`, like a regular user app. Each scenario uses one
app per framework instead of sharing routes in the baseline app. This keeps
route-tree size and router options isolated so one scenario cannot shift
another scenario's numbers. The existing baseline apps and bench names stay
stable for CodSpeed continuity.

## Scenario Responsibilities

Each scenario isolates one client-side responsibility so benchmark changes can
be attributed to a specific feature area.

| Scenario                                 | Client-side responsibility                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `react/`, `solid/`, `vue/` baseline apps | Mixed navigation loop: path params, search params, route context, and `useParams`/`useSearch`/`useLoaderData` selector subscriptions.                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| `async-pipeline`                         | The router's async pipeline via counted 0ms timer hops: async loaders (transition-held navigation), async `beforeLoad` context, and parallel nested async loaders. Component-level `Await`/Suspense is excluded: React 19 throttles Suspense reveals by ~300ms wall-clock, which is inherently non-deterministic to benchmark.       |
| `control-flow`                           | Loader-thrown `redirect` (including a 2-hop chain), `notFound()` with `notFoundComponent`, loader errors with `errorComponent`, and boundary reset on recovery navigation.                                                                                                                                                           |
| `head`                                   | `HeadContent` per-navigation work: nested route `head()` evaluation, title/meta/link dedupe across matches, and head tag DOM updates during navigation.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `history`                                | History push/replace/back/forward traversal, location masking, registered-but-never-blocking `useBlocker`, and `useCanGoBack`/`useLocation` subscriptions.                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `links`                                  | Per-navigation cost of ~200 mounted `<Link>`s: link prop building, active-state recompute across `activeOptions` variants, `activeProps` swaps, and `useMatchRoute` probes (the `MatchRoute` component is avoided: vue-router's implementation leaks one subscription per render).                                                   |
| `loaders`                                | Client loader dispatch: always-stale re-runs (`staleTime: 0`), cached revisits (re-run once per lap by the `invalidate` step), `loaderDeps`-keyed caching, `router.invalidate()`, and `useLoaderData` selectors.                                                                                                                     |
| `mount`                                  | Cold start: `createRouter` (route-tree processing) + first render + initial `router.load()` + unmount, with a fresh router per mount. The only scenario measuring router creation.                                                                                                                                                   |
| `nested-params`                          | Deep nesting (8 dynamic levels): per-level `params.parse`/`stringify`, `beforeLoad` context accumulation across matches, and per-level `useParams`/`useRouteContext` subscriptions. Param values include characters requiring percent-encoding (as do `route-tree-scale`'s), so segment encode/decode paths run on every navigation. |
| `preload`                                | Intent preloading from hover events, programmatic `router.preloadRoute`, deterministic preload cache behavior (`defaultPreloadStaleTime: 0`), and commit-time cache maintenance.                                                                                                                                                     |
| `rewrites`                               | Composed client-side location rewrites: router `basepath` plus a locale input/output rewrite pair, running on every href build and location parse (the client analog of the SSR `rewrites` scenario).                                                                                                                                |
| `route-tree-scale`                       | Route matching and link-target resolution on a wide (~40 route) tree mixing static, dynamic, prefixed-param, splat, pathless-layout, and route-group paths, with `autoCodeSplitting` enabled so navigations also resolve lazy route chunks.                                                                                          |
| `search-params`                          | `validateSearch` execution, search middlewares (`retainSearchParams`/`stripSearchParams`), functional search updaters, structural sharing, and `useSearch` selector subscriptions.                                                                                                                                                   |

## Conventions

- Apps are built with `NODE_ENV=production` (`minify: false`) into `dist/app.js`; benches import the built bundle, so production package builds and production JSX output are measured, not dev transforms.
- Scenarios behave like a real user app: navigation happens through `<Link>` clicks dispatched on real anchor elements (unless a scenario specifically measures the imperative API), the router uses the default browser history, and `scrollRestoration` is enabled.
- Each benchmark iteration advances a fixed, circular sequence of steps; every step awaits the router's `onRendered` event, so render work is included and steps cannot overlap. No two consecutive steps may target the same location, and the sequence ends back on the initial route.
- Setup runs one warm-up lap through the sequence and asserts each step's observable output (e.g. `document.title`), so a scenario that silently stops doing its work fails instead of reporting a fast time.
- Determinism: no wall-clock timers (async work is resolved promises or counted `setTimeout(0)` hops), `staleTime`/`gcTime` only ever `0` or effectively-infinite, no `Math.random`/`Date.now` in the measured loop. Scroll restoration uses `getScrollRestorationKey: (location) => location.pathname` so its cache stays bounded (the default random per-entry key grows one cache entry per push navigation). The `mount` scenario opts out of `scrollRestoration` entirely and destroys its history on unmount — both register page-lifetime globals that would leak across its mount/unmount loop.
- Push-only step laps grow jsdom's session-history entry list over a run (jsdom never truncates entries behind the current index). Per-push cost stays O(1) so timings are unaffected; only the `history` scenario needs — and has — a lap that is depth-stationary.
- Calibration: pick per-iteration step counts so a bench's `vitest bench` run stays roughly between 8 and 30 seconds (long enough to average out, short enough for CI).

## Run

Run all benchmarks through Nx so dependency builds are part of the graph:

```bash
CI=1 NX_DAEMON=false pnpm nx run @benchmarks/client-nav:test:perf --outputStyle=stream --skipRemoteCache
```

Run framework-specific benchmarks (baseline + all scenarios):

```bash
CI=1 NX_DAEMON=false pnpm nx run @benchmarks/client-nav:test:perf:react --outputStyle=stream --skipRemoteCache
CI=1 NX_DAEMON=false pnpm nx run @benchmarks/client-nav:test:perf:solid --outputStyle=stream --skipRemoteCache
CI=1 NX_DAEMON=false pnpm nx run @benchmarks/client-nav:test:perf:vue --outputStyle=stream --skipRemoteCache
```

Run a single scenario app manually (after building it through Nx):

```bash
CI=1 NX_DAEMON=false pnpm nx run @benchmarks/client-nav-<scenario>-<framework>:build:client --outputStyle=stream --skipRemoteCache
cd benchmarks/client-nav && NODE_ENV=production vitest bench --config ./scenarios/<scenario>/<framework>/vite.config.ts
```

Run framework-specific flame benchmarks (10 second loop, profiled with `@platformatic/flame`, forced to `NODE_ENV=production`):

```bash
# baseline
CI=1 NX_DAEMON=false pnpm nx run @benchmarks/client-nav:test:flame:react --outputStyle=stream --skipRemoteCache
CI=1 NX_DAEMON=false pnpm nx run @benchmarks/client-nav:test:flame:solid --outputStyle=stream --skipRemoteCache

# scenarios
CI=1 NX_DAEMON=false pnpm nx run @benchmarks/client-nav-<scenario>-<framework>:test:flame --outputStyle=stream --skipRemoteCache
```

Typecheck benchmark sources (baseline + scenarios):

```bash
CI=1 NX_DAEMON=false pnpm nx run @benchmarks/client-nav:test:types --outputStyle=stream --skipRemoteCache
```

## Opt-in React Link performance suite

`link-performance/` contains additional client-navigation and SSR workloads for
focused Link work. They are **not included** in the regular client-nav/SSR
aggregate projects or their CodSpeed build dependencies. Benchmark discovery
also requires `TSR_LINK_PERF=1`; without it, no extended benchmark files or app
bundles are imported.

```bash
TSR_LINK_PERF=1 CI=1 NX_DAEMON=false pnpm nx run @benchmarks/react-link-performance:test:perf:client --outputStyle=stream --skipRemoteCache -- --run
TSR_LINK_PERF=1 CI=1 NX_DAEMON=false pnpm nx run @benchmarks/react-link-performance:test:perf:ssr --outputStyle=stream --skipRemoteCache -- --run

# Select a feature and save the normal Vitest JSON report.
TSR_LINK_PERF=1 CI=1 NX_DAEMON=false pnpm nx run @benchmarks/react-link-performance:test:perf:client --outputStyle=stream --skipRemoteCache -- --run -t "updater|optional|splat" --outputJson /tmp/link-perf.json
```

The cases cover repeated versus unique destination params, updater functions,
relative/inherited values, search middleware chains, param stringification,
optional and splat segments, encoding, masks, basepath/rewrites, and active
props with structured search. These exercise different costs: cache hits and
misses, parameter cloning, callbacks, middleware traversal, URI encoding,
building masked/public locations, active-state comparisons, and prop merging.
Existing preload, mount, and route-tree-scale scenarios remain responsible for
those separate workloads.

- **Client:** 200 persistent measured Links, four control Links, and eight
  completed navigations per timed batch. The existing client harness checks
  hrefs and active state during its untimed warm-up lap. Control navigations
  replace the history entry, keeping history size constant. Post-measurement
  assertions also check that the measured anchors stayed mounted.
- **SSR:** four fresh-router requests per timed batch, each rendering 200
  measured Links through `RouterProvider` and `renderToString`. Router creation,
  `router.load()`, rendering, and history cleanup are included. This isolates
  Router SSR Link work, not Start HTTP handling, dehydration, or streaming.
  HTML assertions run outside the timed batch.
- Both use the same code-based workload definitions and production JSX/library
  builds. The regular Vitest entry points use at least 100 warm-up iterations,
  one second of warm-up time, and five-second measurement windows. The client
  and server bundles assert their resolved `isServer` environment. React and
  React DOM remain external so comparisons can share the same renderer runtime.
  These bundles are Node-hosted (jsdom for client mode), not browser deployments.

Run the gate tests and typecheck separately:

```bash
CI=1 NX_DAEMON=false pnpm nx run @benchmarks/react-link-performance:test:unit --outputStyle=stream --skipRemoteCache
CI=1 NX_DAEMON=false pnpm nx run @benchmarks/react-link-performance:test:types --outputStyle=stream --skipRemoteCache
```

For before/after comparisons, use identical benchmark files and dependencies
on both refs, build each ref through its Nx targets, and alternate fresh
Vitest processes. Report the actual refs, per-case means and relative margins
of error; rerun noisy or borderline results with `-t` rather than interpreting
a small difference as a proven speedup. Client and SSR times have different
batch units and should not be compared directly.

### Stable paired comparisons

For regression decisions, prefer the paired runner over a whole-file Vitest
run. It starts a fresh process for every case and repetition, avoiding JIT
feedback from earlier cases. Inside each process, both revisions share the
same production React installation but have separate router/app modules and
router instances. Initialization order alternates between repetitions.

```bash
# Build the baseline using these same benchmark sources in its own checkout.
# --baseline points to that checkout's link-performance/dist directory.
TSR_LINK_PERF=1 pnpm nx run @benchmarks/react-link-performance:test:perf:stable -- \
  --baseline /path/to/baseline/benchmarks/client-nav/link-performance/dist \
  --outputJson /tmp/paired-links.json

# Narrow a comparison, or increase independent process repetitions.
TSR_LINK_PERF=1 pnpm nx run @benchmarks/react-link-performance:test:perf:stable -- \
  --baseline /path/to/baseline/benchmarks/client-nav/link-performance/dist \
  --mode ssr -t "middleware|unique-params" --repeats 6 \
  --outputJson /tmp/paired-links-ssr.json
```

The runner requires Node with `process.threadCpuUsage` (Node 24 works).
It fixes V8 random/hash seeds, warms each variant for at least two seconds
and 100 batches, then alternates ABBA/BAAB blocks calibrated to roughly 500 ms.
Both variants do exactly the same number of batches per block. It records
main-thread CPU time, wall time, and whole-process CPU time; GC during
measurement is not disabled or discarded.

The default is four independent process repetitions. Reported 95% intervals
use their paired log-ratios, not the many correlated batches as independent
samples. A faster/slower verdict requires CPU and wall intervals to agree.
Intervals overlapping zero or disagreeing metrics are inconclusive; narrow
intervals entirely inside +/-2% are reported separately.

An A/A calibration uses the current `dist` directory as `--baseline`. Its
intervals should contain zero before trusting similarly sized A/B differences.
Shared-machine contention can still make small changes unresolved. Do not
interpret a point estimate alone, or an inconclusive result, as proof that
a workload is unchanged.
