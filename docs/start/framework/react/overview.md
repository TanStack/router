TanStack Start is a full-stack React framework powered by TanStack Router. It provides a full-document SSR, streaming, server functions, bundling, and more using tools like [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It is ready to deploy to your favorite hosting provider!

## Router or Start?

TanStack Router is a powerful, type-safe, and full-featured routing system for React applications. It is designed to handle the beefiest of full-stack routing requirements with ease.

- Route matching/loading middleware

What you get with TanStack Start:

- Full-document SSR
- Streaming

- Full-Stack Type Safety

**In summary, use TanStack Router for client-side routing and TanStack Start for full-stack routing.**

## How does it work?

TanStack Start uses [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to bundle and deploy your application. In fact, these are the same tools that power Solid Start! With these tools, we can do a few things we couldn't do before:

- Provide a unified API for SSR, streaming, and hydration
- Extract server-only code from your client-side code (e.g. server functions)
- Bundle your application for deployment to any hosting provider

## When should I use it?

TanStack Start is perfect for you if you want to build a full-stack React application with the following requirements:

- Full-document SSR & Hydration
- Streaming
- Server Functions / RPCs
- Full-Stack Type Safety
- Robust Routing
- Rich Client-Side Interactivity

## When might I not want to use it?

TanStack Start is not for you if:

- Your site will be 100% static
- Your goal is a server-rendered site with zero JS or minimal client-side interactivity
- You're looking for a React-Server-Component-first framework. (We'll support RSCs soon in our own awesome flavor!)
