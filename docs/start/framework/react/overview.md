## What is TanStack Start?

**TanStack Start** is a **full-stack React framework** built on top of [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router).  
It provides everything you need for modern app development, including:

- **Full-document SSR**
- **Streaming**
- **Server functions**
- **Bundling**
- **Universal deployment**

Powered by [Vite](https://vite.dev/), it’s fast to develop with, and flexible enough to deploy to **any hosting provider or runtime**.

## Core Dependencies

TanStack Start is powered by two key technologies:

- **[TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router)** → A type-safe router for web apps with advanced features like nested routing, search params, and data loading.  
- **[Vite](https://vite.dev/)** → A lightning-fast build tool that supports hot module replacement (HMR) and optimized production builds.

## Should I use TanStack Start or just TanStack Router?

Since **90% of a framework is its router**, TanStack Start leans fully on TanStack Router.  

With Start, you unlock advanced features beyond just routing:

- ⚡ **Full-document SSR** → Better performance and SEO  
- 🌊 **Streaming** → Progressive page loading  
- 🔌 **Server & API Routes** → Build backend endpoints alongside your frontend  
- 🔒 **Server Functions** → Type-safe RPCs between client and server  
- 🧩 **Middleware & Context** → Advanced request/response handling  
- 📦 **Full-Stack Bundling** → Optimized builds for client + server  
- 🌍 **Universal Deployment** → Deploy anywhere Vite runs  
- ✅ **End-to-End Type Safety** → Strong TypeScript support throughout  

👉 If you’re certain you **don’t need these features**, using **TanStack Router** alone is still a solid and type-safe upgrade over other SPA routers.

## Limitations

Currently, TanStack Start does **not support React Server Components (RSCs)**.  
However, work is underway, and **RSC support is expected soon**.  

Other than that, TanStack Start is comparable to frameworks like **Next.js** or **Remix**, often with more powerful features and a smoother developer experience.
