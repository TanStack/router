## What are Server Functions?

Server functions allow you to specify logic that can be invoked almost anywhere (even the client), but run **only** on the server. In fact, they are not so different from an API Route, but with a few key differences:

- They do not have stable public URL (but you'll be able to do this very soon!)
- They can be called from anywhere in your application, including loaders, hooks, components, etc.

However, they are similar to regular API Routes in that:

- They have access to the request context, allowing you to read headers, set cookies, and more
- They can access sensitive information, such as environment variables, without exposing them to the client
- They can be used to perform any kind of server-side logic, such as fetching data from a database, sending emails, or interacting with other services
- They can return any value, including primitives, JSON-serializable objects, and even raw Response objects
- They can throw errors, including redirects and notFounds, which can be handled automatically by the router

> How are server functions different from "React Server Functions"?
>
> - TanStack Server Functions are not tied to a specific front-end framework, and can be used with any front-end framework or none at all.
> - TanStack Server Functions are backed by standard HTTP requests and can be called as often as you like without suffering from serial-execution bottlenecks.

## How do they work?

Server functions can be defined anywhere in your application, but must be defined at the top level of a file. They can be called throughout your application, including loaders, hooks, etc. Traditionally, this pattern is known as a Remote Procedure Call (RPC), but due to the isomorphic nature of these functions, we refer to them as server functions.

- On the server bundle, server functions logic is left alone. Nothing needs to be done since they are already in the correct place.
- On the client, server functions will be removed; they exist only on the server. Any calls to the server function on the client will be replaced with a `fetch` request to the server to execute the server function, and send the response back to the client.

## Server Function Middleware

Server functions can use middleware to share logic, context, common operations, prerequisites, and much more. To learn more about server function middleware, be sure to read about them in the [Middleware guide](./middleware.md).

## Defining Server Functions

> We'd like to thank the [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) team for both the inspiration of TanStack Start's server function design and guidance while implementing it. We love (and recommend) using tRPC for API Routes so much that we insisted on server functions getting the same 1st class treatment and developer experience. Thank you!

Server functions are defined with the `createServerFn` function, from the `@tanstack/start` package. This function takes an optional `options` argument for specifying the http verb, and allows you to chain off the result to define things like the body of the server function, input validation, middleware, etc. Here's a simple example:

```tsx
// getServerTime.ts
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/start'

export const getServerTime = createServerFn().handler(async () => {
  // Wait for 1 second
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 1000))
  // Return the current time
  return new Date().toISOString()
})
```

## Where can I call server functions?

- From server-side code
- From client-side code
- From other server functions

> [!WARNING]
> Server functions cannot be called from API Routes. If you need to share business logic between server functions and API Routes, extract the shared logic into utility functions that can be imported by both.

## Accepting Parameters

Server functions accept a single parameter, which can be a variety of types:

- Standard JavaScript types
  - `string`
  - `number`
  - `boolean`
  - `null`
  - `Array`
  - `Object`
- FormData
- ReadableStream (of any of the above)
- Promise (of any of the above)

Here's an example of a server function that accepts a simple string parameter:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/start'

export const greet = createServerFn({
  method: 'GET',
})
  .validator((data: string) => data)
  .handler(async (ctx) => {
    return `Hello, ${ctx.data}!`
  })

greet({
  data: 'John',
})
```

## Runtime Input Validation / Type Safety

Server functions can be configured to validate their input data at runtime, while adding type safety. This is useful for ensuring the input is of the correct type before executing the server function, and providing more friendly error messages.

This is done with the `validator` method. It will accept whatever input is passed to the server function. The value (and type) you return from this function will become the input passed to the actual server function handler.

Validators also integrate seamlessly with external validators, if you want to use something like Zod.

### Basic Validation

Here's a simple example of a server function that validates the input parameter:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/start'

type Person = {
  name: string
}

export const greet = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' })
  .validator((person: unknown): Person => {
    if (typeof person !== 'object' || person === null) {
      throw new Error('Person must be an object')
    }

    if ('name' in person && typeof person.name !== 'string') {
      throw new Error('Person.name must be a string')
    }

    return person as Person
  })
  .handler(async ({ data }) => {
    return `Hello, ${data.name}!`
  })
```

### Using a Validation Library

Validation libraries like Zod can be used like so:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/start'

import { z } from 'zod'

const Person = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
})

export const greet = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' })
  .validator((person: unknown) => {
    return Person.parse(person)
  })
  .handler(async (ctx) => {
    return `Hello, ${ctx.data.name}!`
  })

greet({
  data: {
    name: 'John',
  },
})
```

## Type Safety

Since server-functions cross the network boundary, it's important to ensure the data being passed to them is not only the right type, but also validated at runtime. This is especially important when dealing with user input, as it can be unpredictable. To ensure developers validate their I/O data, types are reliant on validation. The return type of the `validator` function will be the input to the server function's handler.

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/start'

type Person = {
  name: string
}

export const greet = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' })
  .validator((person: unknown): Person => {
    if (typeof person !== 'object' || person === null) {
      throw new Error('Person must be an object')
    }

    if ('name' in person && typeof person.name !== 'string') {
      throw new Error('Person.name must be a string')
    }

    return person as Person
  })
  .handler(
    async ({
      data, // Person
    }) => {
      return `Hello, ${data.name}!`
    },
  )

function test() {
  greet({ data: { name: 'John' } }) // OK
  greet({ data: { name: 123 } }) // Error: Argument of type '{ name: number; }' is not assignable to parameter of type 'Person'.
}
```

## Inference

Server functions infer their input, and output types based on the input to the `validator`, and return value of `handler` functions, respectively. In fact, the `validator` you define can even have its own separate input/output types, which can be useful if your validator performs transformations on the input data.

To illustrate this, let's take a look at an example using the `zod` validation library:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/start'
import { z } from 'zod'

const transactionSchema = z.object({
  amount: z.string().transform((val) => parseInt(val, 10)),
})

const createTransaction = createServerFn()
  .validator(transactionSchema)
  .handler(({ data }) => {
    return data.amount // Returns a number
  })

createTransaction({
  data: {
    amount: '123', // Accepts a string
  },
})
```

## Non-Validated Inference

While we highly recommend using a validation library to validate your network I/O data, you may, for whatever reason _not_ want to validate your data, but still have type safety. To do this, provide type information to the server function using an identity function as the `validator`, that types the input, and or output to the correct types:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/start'

type Person = {
  name: string
}

export const greet = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' })
  .validator((d: Person) => d)
  .handler(async (ctx) => {
    return `Hello, ${ctx.data.name}!`
  })

greet({
  data: {
    name: 'John',
  },
})
```

## JSON Parameters

Server functions can accept JSON-serializable objects as parameters. This is useful for passing complex data structures to the server:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/start'

type Person = {
  name: string
  age: number
}

export const greet = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' })
  .validator((data: Person) => data)
  .handler(async ({ data }) => {
    return `Hello, ${data.name}! You are ${data.age} years old.`
  })

greet({
  data: {
    name: 'John',
    age: 34,
  },
})
```

## FormData Parameters

Server functions can accept `FormData` objects as parameters

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/start'

export const greetUser = createServerFn({ method: 'POST' })
  .validator((data) => {
    if (!(data instanceof FormData)) {
      throw new Error('Invalid form data')
    }
    const name = data.get('name')
    const age = data.get('age')

    if (!name || !age) {
      throw new Error('Name and age are required')
    }

    return {
      name: name.toString(),
      age: parseInt(age.toString(), 10),
    }
  })
  .handler(async ({ data: { name, age } }) => {
    return `Hello, ${name}! You are ${age} years old.`
  })

// Usage
function Test() {
  return (
    <form
      onSubmit={async (event) => {
        event.preventDefault()
        const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget)
        const response = await greetUser({ data: formData })
        console.log(response)
      }}
    >
      <input name="name" />
      <input name="age" />
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

## Server Function Context

In addition to the single parameter that server functions accept, you can also access server request context from within any server function using utilities from `@tanstack/start/server`. Under the hood, we use [Unjs](https://unjs.io/)'s `h3` package to perform cross-platform HTTP requests.

There are many context functions available to you for things like:

- Accessing the request context
- Accessing/setting headers
- Accessing/setting sessions/cookies
- Setting response status codes and status messages
- Dealing with multi-part form data
- Reading/Setting custom server context properties

For a full list of available context functions, see all of the available [h3 Methods](https://h3.unjs.io/utils/request) or inspect the [@tanstack/start/server Source Code](https://github.com/tanstack/router/tree/main/packages/start/src/server/index.tsx).

For starters, here are a few examples:

## Accessing the Request Context

Let's use the `getWebRequest` function to access the request itself from within a server function:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/start'
import { getWebRequest } from '@tanstack/start/server'

export const getServerTime = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(
  async () => {
    const request = getWebRequest()

    console.log(request.method) // GET

    console.log(request.headers.get('User-Agent')) // Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3
  },
)
```

## Accessing Headers

Use the `getHeaders` function to access all headers from within a server function:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/start'
import { getHeaders } from '@tanstack/start/server'

export const getServerTime = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(
  async () => {
    console.log(getHeaders())
    // {
    //   "accept": "*/*",
    //   "accept-encoding": "gzip, deflate, br",
    //   "accept-language": "en-US,en;q=0.9",
    //   "connection": "keep-alive",
    //   "host": "localhost:3000",
    //   ...
    // }
  },
)
```

You can also access individual headers using the `getHeader` function:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/start'
import { getHeader } from '@tanstack/start/server'

export const getServerTime = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(
  async () => {
    console.log(getHeader('User-Agent')) // Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3
  },
)
```

## Returning Values

Server functions can return a few different types of values:

- Primitives
- JSON-serializable objects
- `redirect` errors (can also be thrown)
- `notFound` errors (can also be thrown)
- Raw Response objects

## Returning Primitives and JSON

To return any primitive or JSON-serializable object, simply return the value from the server function:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/start'

export const getServerTime = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(
  async () => {
    return new Date().toISOString()
  },
)

export const getServerData = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(
  async () => {
    return {
      message: 'Hello, World!',
    }
  },
)
```

By default, server functions assume that any non-Response object returned is either a primitive or JSON-serializable object.

## Responding with Custom Headers

To respond with custom headers, you can use the `setHeader` function:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/start'
import { setHeader } from '@tanstack/start/server'

export const getServerTime = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(
  async () => {
    setHeader('X-Custom-Header', 'value')
    return new Date().toISOString()
  },
)
```

## Responding with Custom Status Codes

To respond with a custom status code, you can use the `setResponseStatus` function:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/start'
import { setResponseStatus } from '@tanstack/start/server'

export const getServerTime = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(
  async () => {
    setResponseStatus(201)
    return new Date().toISOString()
  },
)
```

## Returning Raw Response objects

To return a raw Response object, simply return a Response object from the server function:

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/start'

export const getServerTime = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(
  async () => {
    // Read a file from s3
    return fetch('https://example.com/time.txt')
  },
)
```

## Throwing Errors

Aside from special `redirect` and `notFound` errors, server functions can throw any custom error. These errors will be serialized and sent to the client as a JSON response along with a 500 status code.

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/start'

export const doStuff = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(async () => {
  throw new Error('Something went wrong!')
})

// Usage
function Test() {
  try {
    await doStuff()
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error)
    // {
    //   message: "Something went wrong!",
    //   stack: "Error: Something went wrong!\n    at doStuff (file:///path/to/file.ts:3:3)"
    // }
  }
}
```

## Cancellation

On the client, server function calls can be cancelled via an `AbortSignal`.
On the server, an `AbortSignal` will notify if the request closed before execution finished.

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/start'

export const abortableServerFn = createServerFn().handler(
  async ({ signal }) => {
    return new Promise<string>((resolve, reject) => {
      if (signal.aborted) {
        return reject(new Error('Aborted before start'))
      }
      const timerId = setTimeout(() => {
        console.log('server function finished')
        resolve('server function result')
      }, 1000)
      const onAbort = () => {
        clearTimeout(timerId)
        console.log('server function aborted')
        reject(new Error('Aborted'))
      }
      signal.addEventListener('abort', onAbort, { once: true })
    })
  },
)

// Usage
function Test() {
  const controller = new AbortController()
  const serverFnPromise = abortableServerFn({
    signal: controller.signal,
  })
  await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, 500))
  controller.abort()
  try {
    const serverFnResult = await serverFnPromise
    console.log(serverFnResult) // should never get here
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error) // "signal is aborted without reason"
  }
}
```

## Calling server functions from within route lifecycles

Server functions can be called normally from route `loader`s, `beforeLoad`s, or any other router-controlled APIs. These APIs are equipped to handle errors, redirects, and notFounds thrown by server functions automatically.

```tsx
import { getServerTime } from './getServerTime'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/time')({
  loader: async () => {
    const time = await getServerTime()

    return {
      time,
    }
  },
})
```

## Calling server functions from hooks and components

Server functions can throw `redirect`s or `notFound`s and while not required, it is recommended to catch these errors and handle them appropriately. To make this easier, the `@tanstack/start` package exports a `useServerFn` hook that can be used to bind server functions to components and hooks:

```tsx
import { useServerFn } from '@tanstack/start'
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query'
import { getServerTime } from './getServerTime'

export function Time() {
  const getTime = useServerFn(getServerTime)

  const timeQuery = useQuery({
    queryKey: 'time',
    queryFn: () => getTime(),
  })
}
```

## Calling server functions anywhere else

When using server functions, be aware that redirects and notFounds they throw will only be handled automatically when called from:

- Route lifecycles
- Components using the useServerFn hook

For other usage locations, you'll need to handle these cases manually.

## Redirects

Server functions can throw a `redirect` error to redirect the user to a different URL. This is useful for handling authentication, authorization, or other scenarios where you need to redirect the user to a different page.

- During SSR, redirects are handled by sending a 302 response to the client with the new location
- On the client, redirects are handled by the router automatically from within a route lifecycle or a component that uses the `useServerFn` hook. If you call a server function from anywhere else, redirects will not be handled automatically.

To throw a redirect, you can use the `redirect` function exported from the `@tanstack/react-router` package:

```tsx
import { redirect } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/start'

export const doStuff = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(async () => {
  // Redirect the user to the home page
  throw redirect({
    to: '/',
  })
})
```

Redirects can utilize all of the same options as `router.navigate`, `useNavigate()` and `<Link>` components. So feel free to also pass:

- Path Params
- Search Params
- Hash

Redirects can also set the status code of the response by passing a `status` option:

```tsx
import { redirect } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/start'

export const doStuff = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(async () => {
  // Redirect the user to the home page with a 301 status code
  throw redirect({
    to: '/',
    status: 301,
  })
})
```

You can also redirect to an external target using `href`:

```tsx
import { redirect } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/start'

export const auth = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(async () => {
  // Redirect the user to the auth provider
  throw redirect({
    href: 'https://authprovider.com/login',
  })
})
```

> ⚠️ Do not use `@tanstack/start/server`'s `sendRedirect` function to send soft redirects from within server functions. This will send the redirect using the `Location` header and will force a full page hard navigation on the client.

## Redirect Headers

You can also set custom headers on a redirect by passing a `headers` option:

```tsx
import { redirect } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/start'

export const doStuff = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(async () => {
  // Redirect the user to the home page with a custom header
  throw redirect({
    to: '/',
    headers: {
      'X-Custom-Header': 'value',
    },
  })
})
```

## Not Found

While calling a server function from a `loader` or `beforeLoad` route lifecycle, a special `notFound` error can be thrown to indicate to the router that the requested resource was not found. This is more useful than a simple 404 status code, as it allows you to render a custom 404 page, or handle the error in a custom way. If notFound is thrown from a server function used outside of a route lifecycle, it will not be handled automatically.

To throw a notFound, you can use the `notFound` function exported from the `@tanstack/react-router` package:

```tsx
import { notFound } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/start'

const getStuff = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(async () => {
  // Randomly return a not found error
  if (Math.random() < 0.5) {
    throw notFound()
  }

  // Or return some stuff
  return {
    stuff: 'stuff',
  }
})

export const Route = createFileRoute('/stuff')({
  loader: async () => {
    const stuff = await getStuff()

    return {
      stuff,
    }
  },
})
```

Not found errors are a core feature of TanStack Router,

## Handling Errors

If a server function throws a (non-redirect/non-notFound) error, it will be serialized and sent to the client as a JSON response along with a 500 status code. This is useful for debugging, but you may want to handle these errors in a more user-friendly way. You can do this by catching the error and handling it in your route lifecycle, component, or hook as you normally would.

```tsx
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/start'

export const doStuff = createServerFn({ method: 'GET' }).handler(async () => {
  undefined.foo()
})

export const Route = createFileRoute('/stuff')({
  loader: async () => {
    try {
      await doStuff()
    } catch (error) {
      // Handle the error:
      // error === {
      //   message: "Cannot read property 'foo' of undefined",
      //   stack: "TypeError: Cannot read property 'foo' of undefined\n    at doStuff (file:///path/to/file.ts:3:3)"
    }
  },
})
```

## No-JS Server Functions

Without JavaScript enabled, there's only one way to execute server functions: by submitting a form.

This is done by adding a `form` element to the page
with [the HTML attribute `action`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLFormElement/action).

> Notice that we mentioned the **HTML** attribute `action`. This attribute only accepts a string in HTML, just like all
> other attributes.
>
> While React
> 19 [added support for passing a function to `action`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/components/form#form),
> it's
> a React-specific feature and not part of the HTML standard.

The `action` attribute tells the browser where to send the form data when the form is submitted. In this case, we want
to send the form data to the server function.

To do this, we can utilize the `url` property of the server function:

```ts
const yourFn = createServerFn({ method: 'POST' })
  .validator((formData) => {
    if (!(formData instanceof FormData)) {
      throw new Error('Invalid form data')
    }

    const name = formData.get('name')

    if (!name) {
      throw new Error('Name is required')
    }

    return name
  })
  .handler(async ({ data: name }) => {
    console.log(name) // 'John'
  })

console.info(yourFn.url)
```

And pass this to the `action` attribute of the form:

```tsx
function Component() {
  return (
    <form action={yourFn.url} method="POST">
      <input name="name" defaultValue="John" />
      <button type="submit">Click me!</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

When the form is submitted, the server function will be executed.

### No-JS Server Function Arguments

To pass arguments to a server function when submitting a form, you can use the `input` element with the `name` attribute
to attach the argument to the [`FormData`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/FormData) passed to your
server function:

```tsx
const yourFn = createServerFn({ method: 'POST' })
  .validator((formData) => {
    if (!(formData instanceof FormData)) {
      throw new Error('Invalid form data')
    }

    const age = formData.get('age')

    if (!age) {
      throw new Error('age is required')
    }

    return age.toString()
  })
  .handler(async ({ data: formData }) => {
    // `age` will be '123'
    const age = formData.get('age')
    // ...
  })

function Component() {
  return (
    //  We need to tell the server that our data type is `multipart/form-data` by setting the `encType` attribute on the form.
    <form action={yourFn.url} method="POST" encType="multipart/form-data">
      <input name="age" defaultValue="34" />
      <button type="submit">Click me!</button>
    </form>
  )
}
```

When the form is submitted, the server function will be executed with the form's data as an argument.

### No-JS Server Function Return Value

Regardless of whether JavaScript is enabled, the server function will return a response to the HTTP request made from
the client.

When JavaScript is enabled, this response can be accessed as the return value of the server function in the client's
JavaScript code.

```ts
const yourFn = createServerFn().handler(async () => {
  return 'Hello, world!'
})

// `.then` is not available when JavaScript is disabled
yourFn().then(console.log)
```

However, when JavaScript is disabled, there is no way to access the return value of the server function in the client's
JavaScript code.

Instead, the server function can provide a response to the client, telling the browser to navigate in a certain way.

When combined with a `loader` from TanStack Router, we're able to provide an experience similar to a single-page application, even when
JavaScript is disabled;
all by telling the browser to reload the current page with new data piped through the `loader`:

```tsx
import * as fs from 'fs'
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { createServerFn } from '@tanstack/start'

const filePath = 'count.txt'

async function readCount() {
  return parseInt(
    await fs.promises.readFile(filePath, 'utf-8').catch(() => '0'),
  )
}

const getCount = createServerFn({
  method: 'GET',
}).handler(() => {
  return readCount()
})

const updateCount = createServerFn({ method: 'POST' })
  .validator((formData) => {
    if (!(formData instanceof FormData)) {
      throw new Error('Invalid form data')
    }

    const addBy = formData.get('addBy')

    if (!addBy) {
      throw new Error('addBy is required')
    }

    return parseInt(addBy.toString())
  })
  .handler(async ({ data: addByAmount }) => {
    const count = await readCount()
    await fs.promises.writeFile(filePath, `${count + addByAmount}`)
    // Reload the page to trigger the loader again
    return new Response('ok', { status: 301, headers: { Location: '/' } })
  })

export const Route = createFileRoute('/')({
  component: Home,
  loader: async () => await getCount(),
})

function Home() {
  const state = Route.useLoaderData()

  return (
    <div>
      <form
        action={updateCount.url}
        method="POST"
        encType="multipart/form-data"
      >
        <input type="number" name="addBy" defaultValue="1" />
        <button type="submit">Add</button>
      </form>
      <pre>{state}</pre>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Static Server Functions

When using prerendering/static-generation, server functions can also be "static", which enables their results to be cached at build time and served as static assets.

Learn all about this pattern on the [Static Server Functions](../static-server-functions) page.

## How are server functions compiled?

Under the hood, server functions are extracted out of the client bundle and into a separate server bundle. On the server, they are executed as-is, and the result is sent back to the client. On the client, server functions proxy the request to the server, which executes the function and sends the result back to the client, all via `fetch`.

The process looks like this:

- When `createServerFn` is found in a file, the inner function is checked for a `use server` directive
- If the `use server` directive is missing, it is added to the top of the function
- On the client, the inner function is extracted out of the client bundle and into a separate server bundle
- The client-side server function is replaced with a proxy function that sends a request to the server to execute the function that was extracted
- On the server, the server function is not extracted, and is executed as-is
- After extraction occurs, each bundle applies a dead-code elimination process to remove any unused code from each bundle.
