title: Static Prerendering
---

Static prerendering is the process of generating static HTML files for your application. This can be useful for either improving the performance of your application, as it allows you to serve pre-rendered HTML files to users without having to generate them on the fly or for deploying static sites to platforms that do not support server-side rendering.

## Automatic Static Route Discovery

When you don't specify a `pages` array in your prerendering configuration, TanStack Start will automatically discover and prerender all static routes in your application. This includes:

- Routes with no path parameters (e.g., `/about`, `/contact`)
- Routes with search parameters that have default values
- Routes that don't require dynamic data fetching

Routes with path parameters (e.g., `/users/$userId`) are excluded from automatic discovery since they require specific parameter values to be prerendered.

## Manual Page Configuration

TanStack Start can prerender your application to static HTML files, which can then be served to users without having to generate them on the fly. When prerendering is enabled without specifying pages, TanStack Start will automatically discover and prerender all static routes in your application.

To prerender your application, you can add the `prerender` option to your tanstackStart configuration in `vite.config.ts` file:

```ts
// vite.config.ts

import { tanstackStart } from '@tanstack/react-start/plugin/vite'
import viteReact from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    tanstackStart({
      prerender: {
        // Enable prerendering
        enabled: true,

        // Enable if you need pages to be at `/page/index.html` instead of `/page.html`
        autoSubfolderIndex: true,

        // How many prerender jobs to run at once
        concurrency: 14,

        // Whether to extract links from the HTML and prerender them also
        crawlLinks: true,

        // Filter function takes the page object and returns whether it should prerender
        filter: ({ path }) => !path.startsWith('/do-not-render-me'),

        // Number of times to retry a failed prerender job
        retryCount: 2,

        // Delay between retries in milliseconds
        retryDelay: 1000,

        // Maximum number of redirects to follow during prerendering
        maxRedirect: 5,

        // Callback when page is successfully rendered
        onSuccess: ({ page }) => {
          console.log(`Rendered ${page.path}!`)
        },
      },
      // Optional configuration for specific pages
      // Note: When pages are not specified, TanStack Start will automatically
      // discover and prerender all static routes in your application
      pages: [
        {
          path: '/my-page',
          prerender: { enabled: true, outputPath: '/my-page/index.html' },
        },
      ],
    }),
    viteReact(),
  ],
})
```
