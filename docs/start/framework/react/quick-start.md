## Impatient?

If you're impatient, you can clone and run the [Basic](../examples/start-basic) example right away with the following commands:

```bash
npx degit https://github.com/tanstack/router/examples/react/start-basic start-basic
cd start-basic
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you'd like to use a different example, you can replace `start-basic` above with the slug of the example you'd like to use from the list below.

Once you've cloned the example you want, head back to the [Learn the Basics](../learn-the-basics) guide to learn how to use TanStack Start!
