## Migrate an existing project from another framework

- [Start a new project from scratch](#start-a-new-project-from-scratch) to quickly learn how Start works (see below)
- Refer to a migration guide for your specific framework:
  - [Next.js](./migrate-from-next-js)
  - Remix 2 / React Router 7 "Framework Mode" (coming soon!)

## Start a new project from scratch

Choose one of the following options to start building a _new_ TanStack Start project:

- [TanStack Start CLI](./quick-start) - Just run `npm create @tanstack/start@latest`. Local, fast, and optionally customizable
- [TanStack Builder](#) (coming soon!) - A visual interface to configure new TanStack projects with a few clicks
- [Quick Start Examples](./quick-start) Download or clone one of our official examples
- [Build a project from scratch](./build-from-scratch) - A guide to building a TanStack Start project line-by-line, file-by-file.

## Next Steps

Unless you chose to build a project from scratch, you can now move on to the [Routing](./guide/routing) guide to learn how to use TanStack Start!
