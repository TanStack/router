## Impatient?

The fastest way to get a Start project up and running is with the cli. Just run

```
pnpm create @tanstack/start@latest
```

or

```
npm create @tanstack/start@latest
```

depending on your package manage of choice. You'll be prompted to add things like Tailwind, eslint, and a ton of other options.

You can also clone and run the [Basic](https://github.com/TanStack/router/tree/main/examples/solid/start-basic) example right away with the following commands:

```bash
npx gitpick TanStack/router/tree/main/examples/solid/start-basic start-basic
cd start-basic
npm install
npm run dev
```

If you'd like to use a different example, you can replace `start-basic` above with the slug of the example you'd like to use from the list below.

Once you've cloned the example you want, head back to the [Routing](../routing) guide to learn how to use TanStack Start!
