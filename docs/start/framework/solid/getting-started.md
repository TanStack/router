## Start a new project from scratch

Choose one of the following options to start building a _new_ TanStack Start project:

- [TanStack Start CLI](./quick-start) - Just run `npx @tanstack/cli create --framework solid`. Local, fast, and optionally customizable
- [TanStack Builder](https://tanstack.com/builder) - A visual interface to configure new TanStack projects with a few clicks
- [Issue repro baseline](https://github.com/TanStack/router/tree/main/examples/solid/start-basic) - A minimal starter we keep stable for bug reports and reproductions
- [Build a project from scratch](./build-from-scratch) - A guide to building a TanStack Start project line-by-line, file-by-file.

## Next Steps

Unless you chose to build a project from scratch, you can now move on to the [Routing](./guide/routing) guide to learn how to use TanStack Start!
