## Start a new project from scratch

Choose one of the following options to start building a _new_ TanStack Start project:

- [TanStack Builder](#) (coming soon!) - A visual interface to configure new TanStack projects with a few clicks
- [Quick Start Examples](./quick-start) Download or clone one of our official examples
- [Build a project from scratch](./build-from-scratch) - A guide to building a TanStack Start project line-by-line, file-by-file.

## Next Steps

Unless you chose to build a project from scratch, you can now move on to the [Routing](./guide/routing) guide to learn how to use TanStack Start!
