---

TanStack Router is designed to run loaders in parallel and wait for all of them to resolve before rendering the next route. This is great most of the time, but occasionally, you may want to show the user something sooner while the rest of the data loads in the background.

Deferred data loading is a pattern that allows the router to render the next location's critical data/markup while slower, non-critical route data is resolved in the background. This process works on both the client and server (via streaming) and is a great way to improve the perceived performance of your application.

If you are using a library like [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) or any other data fetching library, then deferred data loading works a bit differently. Skip ahead to the [Deferred Data Loading with External Libraries](#deferred-data-loading-with-external-libraries) section for more information.

## Deferred Data Loading with `Await`

To defer slow or non-critical data, return an **unawaited/unresolved** promise anywhere in your loader response:

```tsx
// src/routes/posts.$postId.tsx
import { createFileRoute, defer } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/posts/$postId')({
  loader: async () => {
    // Fetch some slower data, but do not await it
    const slowDataPromise = fetchSlowData()

    // Fetch and await some data that resolves quickly
    const fastData = await fetchFastData()

    return {
      fastData,
      deferredSlowData: slowDataPromise,
    }
  },
})
```

As soon as any awaited promises are resolved, the next route will begin rendering while the deferred promises continue to resolve.

In the component, deferred promises can be resolved and utilized using the `Await` component:

```tsx
// src/routes/posts.$postId.tsx
import { createFileRoute, Await } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/posts/$postId')({
  // ...
  component: PostIdComponent,
})

function PostIdComponent() {
  const { deferredSlowData, fastData } = Route.useLoaderData()

  // do something with fastData

  return (
    <Await promise={deferredSlowData} fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      {(data) => {
        return <div>{data}</div>
      }}
    </Await>
  )
}
```

> [!TIP]
> If your component is code-split, you can use the [getRouteApi function](./code-splitting.md#manually-accessing-route-apis-in-other-files-with-the-getrouteapi-helper) to avoid having to import the `Route` configuration to get access to the typed `useLoaderData()` hook.

The `Await` component resolves the promise by triggering the nearest suspense boundary until it is resolved, after which it renders the component's `children` as a function with the resolved data.

If the promise is rejected, the `Await` component will throw the serialized error, which can be caught by the nearest error boundary.

## Deferred Data Loading with External libraries

When your strategy for fetching information for the route relies on [External Data Loading](./external-data-loading.md) with an external library like [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query), deferred data loading works a bit differently, as the library handles the data fetching and caching for you outside of TanStack Router.

So, instead of using `defer` and `Await`, you'll instead want to use the Route's `loader` to kick off the data fetching and then use the library's hooks to access the data in your components.

```tsx
// src/routes/posts.$postId.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { slowDataOptions, fastDataOptions } from '~/api/query-options'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/posts/$postId')({
  loader: async ({ context: { queryClient } }) => {
    // Kick off the fetching of some slower data, but do not await it
    queryClient.prefetchQuery(slowDataOptions())

    // Fetch and await some data that resolves quickly
    await queryClient.ensureQueryData(fastDataOptions())
  },
})
```

Then in your component, you can use the library's hooks to access the data:

```tsx
// src/routes/posts.$postId.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { useSuspenseQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query'
import { slowDataOptions, fastDataOptions } from '~/api/query-options'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/posts/$postId')({
  // ...
  component: PostIdComponent,
})

function PostIdComponent() {
  const fastData = useSuspenseQuery(fastDataOptions())

  // do something with fastData

  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <SlowDataComponent />
    </Suspense>
  )
}

function SlowDataComponent() {
  const data = useSuspenseQuery(slowDataOptions())

  return <div>{data}</div>
}
```

## Caching and Invalidation

Streamed promises follow the same lifecycle as the loader data they are associated with. They can even be preloaded!

## SSR & Streaming Deferred Data

**Streaming requires a server that supports it and for TanStack Router to be configured to use it properly.**

Please read the entire [Streaming SSR Guide](./ssr.md#streaming-ssr) for step by step instructions on how to set up your server for streaming.

## SSR Streaming Lifecycle

The following is a high-level overview of how deferred data streaming works with TanStack Router:

- Server
  - Promises are marked and tracked as they are returned from route loaders
  - All loaders resolve and any deferred promises are serialized and embedded into the html
  - The route begins to render
  - Deferred promises rendered with the `<Await>` component trigger suspense boundaries, allowing the server to stream html up to that point
- Client
  - The client receives the initial html from the server
  - `<Await>` components suspend with placeholder promises while they wait for their data to resolve on the server
- Server
  - As deferred promises resolve, their results (or errors) are serialized and streamed to the client via an inline script tag
  - The resolved `<Await>` components and their suspense boundaries are resolved and their resulting HTML is streamed to the client along with their dehydrated data
- Client
  - The suspended placeholder promises within `<Await>` are resolved with the streamed data/error responses and either render the result or throw the error to the nearest error boundary
