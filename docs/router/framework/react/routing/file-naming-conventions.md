title: File Naming Conventions
---

File-based routing requires that you follow a few simple file naming conventions to ensure that your routes are generated correctly. The concepts these conventions enable are covered in detail in the [Route Trees & Nesting](./route-trees.md) guide.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Routes starting with `/api` are reserved and cannot not be used for file-based routing. These routes are reserved for future use by the TanStack Start for API routes. If you need to use routes starting with `/api` when using TanStack Router with file-based routing, then you'll need to configure the `apiBase` option to a different value.

| Feature                            | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`__root.tsx`**                   | The root route file must be named `__root.tsx` and must be placed in the root of the configured `routesDirectory`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| **`.` Separator**                  | Routes can use the `.` character to denote a nested route. For example, `blog.post` will be generated as a child of `blog`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| **`$` Token**                      | Route segments with the `$` token are parameterized and will extract the value from the URL pathname as a route `param`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **`_` Prefix**                     | Route segments with the `_` prefix are considered to be pathless routes and will not be used when matching its child routes against the URL pathname.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **`_` Suffix**                     | Route segments with the `_` suffix exclude the route from being nested under any parent routes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **`(folder)` folder name pattern** | A folder that matches this pattern is treated as a **route group**, preventing the folder from being included in the route's URL path.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **`index` Token**                  | Route segments ending with the `index` token (before any file extensions) will match the parent route when the URL pathname matches the parent route exactly. This can be configured via the `indexToken` configuration option, see [options](#options).                                                                                   |
| **`.route.tsx` File Type**         | When using directories to organise routes, the `route` suffix can be used to create a route file at the directory's path. For example, `blog.post.route.tsx` or `blog/post/route.tsx` can be used as the route file for the `/blog/post` route. This can be configured via the `routeToken` configuration option, see [options](#options). |

> **💡 Remember:** The file-naming conventions for your project could be affected by what [options](../../../api/file-based-routing.md) are configured.

## Dynamic Path Params

Dynamic path params can be used in both flat and directory routes to create routes that can match a dynamic segment of the URL path. Dynamic path params are denoted by the `$` character in the filename:

| Filename              | Route Path       | Component Output      |
| --------------------- | ---------------- | --------------------- |
| ...                   | ...              | ...                   |
| ʦ `posts.$postId.tsx` | `/posts/$postId` | `<Root><Posts><Post>` |

We'll learn more about dynamic path params in the [Path Params](./path-params.md) guide.

## Pathless Routes

Pathless routes wrap child routes with either logic or a component without requiring a URL path. Non-path routes are denoted by the `_` character in the filename:

| Filename       | Route Path | Component Output |
| -------------- | ---------- | ---------------- |
| ʦ `_app.tsx`   |            |                  |
| ʦ `_app.a.tsx` | /a         | `<Root><App><A>` |
| ʦ `_app.b.tsx` | /b         | `<Root><App><B>` |
