When adding new how-to guides:

1. Focus on a single, well-defined task
2. Use clear headings and numbered steps

4. Address the most frequent problems at the end
5. Comment out "Common next steps" links until those guides are created
6. In "Related Resources", link to specific relevant resources, not generic documentation
