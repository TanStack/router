# Debugging & Troubleshooting

This directory contains troubleshooting guides and debugging help for common TanStack Router issues. Each guide is designed to be:

- **Problem-focused**: Organized by symptoms and error messages
- **Solution-oriented**: Multiple approaches for different scenarios
- **Searchable**: Easy to find solutions by error message or problem type
- **Reference-style**: Quick lookup rather than step-by-step tutorials

## Available Debugging Guides

- [Build and Bundler Issues](./build-issues.md) - Troubleshoot compilation, bundling, and type generation problems
- [Router Issues](./router-issues.md) - Debug navigation, routing, and state management problems

## Using These Guides

Each debugging guide follows a consistent structure:

1. **Quick Diagnosis** - Common symptoms and how to identify the issue
2. **Error Message â†’ Solution** - Direct mappings from error messages to fixes
3. **By Problem Type** - Organized sections for different categories of issues
4. **Advanced Debugging** - Tools and techniques for complex problems
5. **Prevention Tips** - Best practices to avoid these issues

## Contributing

When adding new debugging content:

1. Organize by error message or symptom first
2. Provide multiple solution approaches when possible
3. Include error message snippets for searchability
4. Link to relevant how-to guides for setup instructions
5. Focus on "what's wrong and how to fix it" rather than "how to set up"

## Difference from How-To Guides

- **How-To Guides**: Step-by-step instructions to accomplish a specific task
- **Debugging Guides**: Problem-solving reference for when things go wrong

For setup and implementation instructions, see the [How-To Guides](../how-to/) directory.
