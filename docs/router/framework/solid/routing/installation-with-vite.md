To use file-based routing with **Vite**, you'll need to install the `@tanstack/router-plugin` package.

```sh
npm install -D @tanstack/router-plugin
```

Once installed, you'll need to add the plugin to your Vite configuration.

```ts
// vite.config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import solid from 'vite-plugin-solid'
import { TanStackRouterVite } from '@tanstack/router-plugin/vite'

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    TanStackRouterVite({ target: 'solid', autoCodeSplitting: true }),
    solid(),
    // ...
  ],
})
```

Or, you can clone our [Quickstart Vite example](https://github.com/TanStack/router/tree/main/examples/react/quickstart-file-based) and get started.

Now that you've added the plugin to your Vite configuration, you're all set to start using file-based routing with TanStack Router.
