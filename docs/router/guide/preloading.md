title: Preloading
---

Preloading in TanStack Router is a way to load a route before the user actually navigates to it. This is useful for routes that are likely to be visited by the user next. For example, if you have a list of posts and the user is likely to click on one of them, you can preload the post route so that it's ready to go when the user clicks on it.

## Supported Preloading Strategies

- Intent
  - Preloading by **"intent"** works by using hover and touch start events on `<Link>` components to preload the dependencies for the destination route.
  - This strategy is useful for preloading routes that the user is likely to visit next.
- Viewport Visibility
  - Preloading by **"viewport**" works by using the Intersection Observer API to preload the dependencies for the destination route when the `<Link>` component is in the viewport.
  - This strategy is useful for preloading routes that are below the fold or off-screen.
- Render
  - Preloading by **"render"** works by preloading the dependencies for the destination route as soon as the `<Link>` component is rendered in the DOM.
  - This strategy is useful for preloading routes that are always needed.

## How long does preloaded data stay in memory?

Successful preloaded loader results can enter the router's in-memory cache with
two independent lifetimes:

- **Freshness defaults to 30 seconds.** Configure it with
  `defaultPreloadStaleTime` or a route's `preloadStaleTime`.
- **Unused retention defaults to 5 minutes.** Configure it with
  `defaultPreloadGcTime` or a route's `preloadGcTime`.
- **The speculative lane is never promoted into router state.** Navigation
  creates its own presentation and can reuse cached loader data. It reruns
  `beforeLoad` unless it adopts the same whole lane while that preload is still
  active.

If you need more control over preloading, caching and/or garbage collection of preloaded data, you should use an external caching library like [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query).

The simplest way to preload routes for your application is to set the `defaultPreload` option to `intent` for your entire router:

<!-- ::start:framework -->

# React

```tsx
import { createRouter } from '@tanstack/react-router'

const router = createRouter({
  // ...
  defaultPreload: 'intent',
})
```

# Solid

```tsx
import { createRouter } from '@tanstack/solid-router'

const router = createRouter({
  // ...
  defaultPreload: 'intent',
})
```

<!-- ::end:framework -->

This will turn on `intent` preloading by default for all `<Link>` components in your application. You can also set the `preload` prop on individual `<Link>` components to override the default behavior.

## Preload Delay

By default, preloading will start after **50ms** of the user hovering or touching a `<Link>` component. You can change this delay by setting the `defaultPreloadDelay` option on your router:

<!-- ::start:framework -->

# React

```tsx
import { createRouter } from '@tanstack/react-router'

const router = createRouter({
  // ...
  defaultPreloadDelay: 100,
})
```

# Solid

```tsx
import { createRouter } from '@tanstack/solid-router'

const router = createRouter({
  // ...
  defaultPreloadDelay: 100,
})
```

<!-- ::end:framework -->

You can also set the `preloadDelay` prop on individual `<Link>` components to override the default behavior on a per-link basis.

## Built-in Preloading, Freshness, and Retention

If you're using the built-in loaders, you can control how long preloaded data is considered fresh by setting either `routerOptions.defaultPreloadStaleTime` or `routeOptions.preloadStaleTime` to a number of milliseconds. **By default, preloaded data is considered fresh for 30 seconds.**

Freshness and retention are separate. `preloadStaleTime` controls whether the
retained loader result can be reused without another loader call.
`preloadGcTime` (or `defaultPreloadGcTime`) controls how long an unused preload
result can remain in the in-memory cache. Both preload GC options default to 5
minutes.

To change this, you can set the `defaultPreloadStaleTime` option on your router:

<!-- ::start:framework -->

# React

```tsx
import { createRouter } from '@tanstack/react-router'

const router = createRouter({
  // ...
  defaultPreloadStaleTime: 10_000,
})
```

# Solid

```tsx
import { createRouter } from '@tanstack/solid-router'

const router = createRouter({
  // ...
  defaultPreloadStaleTime: 10_000,
})
```

<!-- ::end:framework -->

Or, you can use the `routeOptions.preloadStaleTime` option on individual routes:

```tsx
// src/routes/posts.$postId.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute('/posts/$postId')({
  loader: async ({ params }) => fetchPost(params.postId),
  // Reload preloaded data when it is more than 10 seconds old
  preloadStaleTime: 10_000,
})
```

Client-side preloading also runs each new route's `beforeLoad` with `preload: true`. A completed preload never caches the context returned by `beforeLoad`; a later navigation calls `beforeLoad` again with `preload: false`, even when it reuses the preload's cached loader data.

There is one exception: if navigation starts while an identical whole-route preload is still running, it can adopt that active work. Compatibility includes the complete ordered route lane, params, search, router context, additional context, user-supplied location state, redirect depth, and any explicit mask's href, search, state, and `unmaskOnReload` value. Router-managed history and temporary-mask keys are ignored. In that case navigation can use the active preload's `beforeLoad` result, or follow its redirect, without calling `beforeLoad` again. A completed, failed, not-found, or canceled preload does not donate `beforeLoad` context to a later navigation. The `shouldReload` option remains loader-only.

If any route in the lane has `preload: false`, navigation does not adopt the active preload. It reruns the `beforeLoad` chain and performs the loader work that speculation skipped.

## Preloading with External Libraries

When integrating external caching libraries like React Query, which have their own mechanisms for determining stale data, you may want to override the default preloading and stale-while-revalidate logic of TanStack Router. These libraries often use options like staleTime to control the freshness of data.

To customize the preloading behavior in TanStack Router and fully leverage your external library's caching strategy, you can bypass the built-in caching by setting routerOptions.defaultPreloadStaleTime or routeOptions.preloadStaleTime to 0. This ensures that all preloads are marked as stale internally, and loaders are always invoked, allowing your external library, such as React Query, to manage data loading and caching.

For example:

<!-- ::start:framework -->

# React

```tsx
import { createRouter } from '@tanstack/react-router'

const router = createRouter({
  // ...
  defaultPreloadStaleTime: 0,
})
```

# Solid

```tsx
import { createRouter } from '@tanstack/solid-router'

const router = createRouter({
  // ...
  defaultPreloadStaleTime: 0,
})
```

<!-- ::end:framework -->

This would then allow you, for instance, to use an option like React Query's `staleTime` to control the freshness of your preloads.

## Preloading Manually

If you need to manually preload a route, use the router's `preloadRoute` method.
It accepts a standard TanStack `NavigateOptions` object and returns the
speculative match lane. An ordinary error or not-found is represented in that
returned lane; cancellation or control flow that produces no reusable lane can
return `undefined`.

<!-- ::start:framework -->

# React

```tsx
function Component() {
  const router = useRouter()

  useEffect(() => {
    async function preload() {
      try {
        const matches = await router.preloadRoute({
          to: postRoute,
          params: { id: 1 },
        })
      } catch (err) {
        // Failed to preload route
      }
    }

    preload()
  }, [router])

  return <div />
}
```

# Solid

```tsx
function Component() {
  const router = useRouter()

  createEffect(() => {
    async function preload() {
      try {
        const matches = await router.preloadRoute({
          to: postRoute,
          params: { id: 1 },
        })
      } catch (err) {
        // Failed to preload route
      }
    }

    preload()
  })

  return <div />
}
```

<!-- ::end:framework -->

If you need to preload only the JS chunk of a route, you can use the router's `loadRouteChunk` method. It accepts a route object and returns a promise that resolves when the route chunk is loaded.

<!-- ::start:framework -->

# React

```tsx
function Component() {
  const router = useRouter()

  useEffect(() => {
    async function preloadRouteChunks() {
      try {
        const postsRoute = router.routesByPath['/posts']
        await Promise.all([
          router.loadRouteChunk(router.routesByPath['/']),
          router.loadRouteChunk(postsRoute),
          router.loadRouteChunk(postsRoute.parentRoute),
        ])
      } catch (err) {
        // Failed to preload route chunk
      }
    }

    preloadRouteChunks()
  }, [router])

  return <div />
}
```

# Solid

```tsx
function Component() {
  const router = useRouter()

  createEffect(() => {
    async function preloadRouteChunks() {
      try {
        const postsRoute = router.routesByPath['/posts']
        await Promise.all([
          router.loadRouteChunk(router.routesByPath['/']),
          router.loadRouteChunk(postsRoute),
          router.loadRouteChunk(postsRoute.parentRoute),
        ])
      } catch (err) {
        // Failed to preload route chunk
      }
    }

    preloadRouteChunks()
  })

  return <div />
}
```
