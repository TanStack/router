title: File-Based Routing API Reference

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not set the `routeFilePrefix`, `routeFileIgnorePrefix`, or `routeFileIgnorePattern` options, to match any of the tokens used in the [file-naming conventions](#file-naming-conventions) section.

- **`routeFilePrefix`**
  - (Optional) If set, only route files and directories that start with this string will be considered for routing.
- **`routeFileIgnorePrefix`**
  - (Optional, **Defaults to `-`**) Route files and directories that start with this string will be ignored. By default this is set to `-` to allow for the use of directories to house related files that do not contain any route files.
- **`routeFileIgnorePattern`**
  - (Optional) Ignore specific files and directories in the route directory. It can be used in regular expression format. For example, `.((css|const).ts)|test-page` will ignore files / directories with names containing `.css.ts`, `.const.ts` or `test-page`.
- **`indexToken`**
  - (Optional, **Defaults to `'index'`**) allows to customize the `index` Token [file naming convention](#file-naming-conventions).
- **`routeToken`**
  - (Optional, **Defaults to `'route'`**) allows to customize the `route` Token [file naming convention](#file-naming-conventions).
- **`routesDirectory`**
  - (Required) The directory containing the routes relative to the cwd.
- **`generatedRouteTree`**
  - (Required) The path to the file where the generated route tree will be saved, relative to the cwd.
- **`autoCodeSplitting`**

  - (Optional, **Defaults to `false`**)
  - If set to `true`, all non-critical route configuration items will be automatically code-split.
  - See the [using automatic code-splitting](./code-splitting.md#using-automatic-code-splitting) guide.

- **`quoteStyle`**
  - (Optional, **Defaults to `single`**) whether to use `single` or `double` quotes when formatting the generated files.
- **`semicolons`**
  - (Optional, **Defaults to `false`**) whether to use semicolons in the generated files.
- **`apiBase`**
  - (Optional) The base path for API routes. Defaults to `/api`.
  - This option is reserved for future use by the TanStack Start for API routes.
- **`disableTypes`**
  - (Optional, **Defaults to `false`**) whether to disable generating types for the route tree
  - If set to `true`, the generated route tree will not include any types.
  - If set to `true` and the `generatedRouteTree` file ends with `.ts` or `.tsx`, the generated route tree will be written as a `.js` file instead.
- **`addExtensions`**
  - (Optional, **Defaults to `false`**) add file extensions to the route names in the generated route tree
- **`disableLogging`**
  - (Optional, **Defaults to `false`**) disables logging for the route generation process
- **`routeTreeFileHeader`**

  - (Optional) An array of strings to prepend to the generated route tree file content.
  - Default:
  - ```
    [
      '/* eslint-disable */',
      '// @ts-nocheck',
      '// noinspection JSUnusedGlobalSymbols'
    ]
    ```

- **`routeTreeFileFooter`**
  - (Optional) An array of strings to append to the generated route tree file content.
  - Default: `[]`
- **`disableManifestGeneration`**
  - (Optional, **Defaults to `false`**) disables generating the route tree manifest

## Route Inclusion / Exclusion

Via the `routeFilePrefix` and `routeFileIgnorePrefix` options, the CLI can be configured to only include files and directories that start with a specific prefix, or to ignore files and directories that start with a specific prefix. This is especially useful when mixing non-route files with route files in the same directory, or when using a flat structure and wanting to exclude certain files from routing.

### Route Inclusion Example

To only consider files and directories that start with `~` for routing, the following configuration can be used:

> ðŸ§  A prefix of `~` is generally recommended when using this option. Not only is this symbol typically associated with the home-folder navigation in unix-based systems, but it is also a valid character for use in filenames and urls that will typically force the file to the top of a directory for easier visual indication of routes.

```json
{
  "routeFilePrefix": "~",
  "routesDirectory": "./src/routes",
  "generatedRouteTree": "./src/routeTree.gen.ts"
}
```

With this configuration, the `Posts.tsx`, `Post.tsx`, and `PostEditor.tsx` files will be ignored during route generation.

```
~__root.tsx
~posts.tsx
~posts
  ~index.tsx
  ~$postId.tsx
  ~$postId
    ~edit.tsx
    PostEditor.tsx
  Post.tsx
Posts.tsx
```

It's also common to use directories to house related files that do not contain any route files:

```
~__root.tsx
~posts.tsx
~posts
  ~index.tsx
  ~$postId.tsx
  ~$postId
    ~edit.tsx
    components
      PostEditor.tsx
  components
    Post.tsx
components
  Posts.tsx
utils
  Posts.tsx
```

### Route Exclusion Example

To ignore files and directories that start with `-` for routing, the following configuration can be used:

> ðŸ§  A prefix of `-` is generally recommended when using this option since the minus symbol is typically associated with removal or exclusion.

```json
{
  "routeFileIgnorePrefix": "-",
  "routesDirectory": "./src/routes",
  "generatedRouteTree": "./src/routeTree.gen.ts"
}
```

With this configuration, the `Posts.tsx`, `Post.tsx`, and `PostEditor.tsx` files will be ignored during route generation.

```
__root.tsx
posts.tsx
posts
  index.tsx
  $postId.tsx
  $postId
    edit.tsx
    -PostEditor.tsx
  -Post.tsx
-Posts.tsx
```

It's also common to use ignored directories to house related files that do not contain any route files:

```
__root.tsx
posts.tsx
posts
  index.tsx
  $postId.tsx
  $postId
    edit.tsx
    -components
      PostEditor.tsx
  -components
    Post.tsx
-components
  Posts.tsx
-utils
  Posts.tsx
```
