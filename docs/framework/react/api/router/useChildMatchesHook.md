title: useChildMatches hook
---

The `useChildMatches` hook returns all of the child [`RouteMatch`](./RouteMatchType.md) objects from the closest match down to the leaf-most match. **It does not include the current match, which can be obtained using the `useMatch` hook.**

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If the router has pending matches and they are showing their pending component fallbacks, `router.state.pendingMatches` will used instead of `router.state.matches`.

## useChildMatches options

The `useChildMatches` hook accepts a single _optional_ argument, an `options` object.

### `opts.select` option

- Optional
- `(matches: RouteMatch[]) => TSelected`
- If supplied, this function will be called with the route matches and the return value will be returned from `useChildMatches`. This value will also be used to determine if the hook should re-render its parent component using shallow equality checks.

### `opts.structuralSharing` option

- Type: `boolean`
- Optional
- Configures whether structural sharing is enabled for the value returned by `select`.
- See the [Render Optimizations guide](../../guide/render-optimizations.md) for more information.

## useChildMatches returns

- If a `select` function is provided, the return value of the `select` function.
- If no `select` function is provided, an array of [`RouteMatch`](./RouteMatchType.md) objects.

## Examples

```tsx
import { useChildMatches } from '@tanstack/react-router'

function Component() {
  const childMatches = useChildMatches()
  // ...
}
```
