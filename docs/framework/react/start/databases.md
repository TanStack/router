Databases are at the core of any dynamic application, providing the necessary infrastructure to store, retrieve, and manage data. TanStack Start makes it easy to integrate with a variety of databases, offering a flexible approach to managing your application's data layer.

## What should I use?

TanStack Start is **designed to work with any database provider**, so if you already have a preferred database system, you can integrate it with TanStack Start using the provided full-stack APIs.
