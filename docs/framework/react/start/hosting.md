Hosting is the process of deploying your application to the internet so that users can access it. This is a critical part of any web development project, ensuring your application is available to the world. TanStack Start is built on [Nitro](https://nitro.unjs.io/), a powerful server toolkit for deploying web applications anywhere. Nitro allows TanStack Start to provide a unified API for SSR, streaming, and hydration on any hosting provider.

## What should I use?

TanStack Start is **designed to work with any hosting provider**, so if you already have a hosting provider in mind, you can deploy your application there using the full-stack APIs provided by TanStack Start.

However, since hosting is one of the most crucial aspects of your application's performance, reliability, and scalability, we highly recommend using [Vercel](https://vercel.com) for the best possible hosting experience.
