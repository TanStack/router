The `basic` example below illustrates a few of the basic concepts you'll encounter in React Location like:

- Creating Routes
- Using path params
- Fetching data in Routes
- Using the Router
- Creating Links
- Styling active Links
- Using Route data in components

  style={{
    width: '100%',
    height: '80vh',
    border: '0',
    borderRadius: 8,
    overflow: 'hidden',
    position: 'static',
    zIndex: 0,
  }}

These concepts make up only a small part of the core functionality of React Location. The next sections of the documentation will go over each of these core features and concepts in more detail.
