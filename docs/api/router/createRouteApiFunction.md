title: getRouteApi function
---

The `getRouteApi` function provides type-safe version of common hooks like `useParams`, `useLoaderData`, `useRouteContext`, and `useSearch` that are pre-bound to a specific route ID and corresponding registered route types.

## Options

#### `routeId`

- Type: `string`
- Required
- The route ID to which the `RouteApi` instance will be bound

### `RouteApi` methods

#### `useMatch`

```tsx
  useMatch<TSelected = TAllContext>(opts?: {
    select?: (match: TAllContext) => TSelected
  }): TSelected
```

- A type-safe version of the `useMatch` hook that is pre-bound to the route ID that the `RouteApi` instance was created with.
- Options
  - `opts.select`
    - Optional
    - `(match: RouteMatch) => TSelected`
    - If supplied, this function will be called with the route match and the return value will be returned from `useMatch`. This value will also be used to determine if the hook should re-render its parent component using shallow equality checks.
- Returns
  - If a `select` function is provided, the return value of the `select` function.
  - If no `select` function is provided, the `RouteMatch` object or a loosened version of the `RouteMatch` object if `opts.strict` is `false`.

#### `useRouteContext`

```tsx
  useRouteContext<TSelected = TAllContext>(opts?: {
    select?: (search: TAllContext) => TSelected
  }): TSelected
```

- A type-safe version of the `useRouteContext` hook that is pre-bound to the route ID that the `RouteApi` instance was created with.
- Options
  - `opts.select`
    - Optional
    - `(match: RouteContext) => TSelected`
    - If supplied, this function will be called with the route match and the return value will be returned from `useRouteContext`. This value will also be used to determine if the hook should re-render its parent component using shallow equality checks.
- Returns
  - If a `select` function is provided, the return value of the `select` function.
  - If no `select` function is provided, the `RouteContext` object or a loosened version of the `RouteContext` object if `opts.strict` is `false`.

#### `useSearch`

```tsx
  useSearch<TSelected = TFullSearchSchema>(opts?: {
    select?: (search: TFullSearchSchema) => TSelected
  }): TSelected
```

- A type-safe version of the `useSearch` hook that is pre-bound to the route ID that the `RouteApi` instance was created with.
- Options
  - `opts.select`
    - Optional
    - `(match: TFullSearchSchema) => TSelected`
    - If supplied, this function will be called with the route match and the return value will be returned from `useSearch`. This value will also be used to determine if the hook should re-render its parent component using shallow equality checks.
- Returns
  - If a `select` function is provided, the return value of the `select` function.
  - If no `select` function is provided, the `TFullSearchSchema` object or a loosened version of the `TFullSearchSchema` object if `opts.strict` is `false`.

#### `useParams`

```tsx
  useParams<TSelected = TAllParams>(opts?: {
    select?: (params: TAllParams) => TSelected
  }): TSelected
```

- A type-safe version of the `useParams` hook that is pre-bound to the route ID that the `RouteApi` instance was created with.
- Options
  - `opts.select`
    - Optional
    - `(match: TAllParams) => TSelected`
    - If supplied, this function will be called with the route match and the return value will be returned from `useParams`. This value will also be used to determine if the hook should re-render its parent component using shallow equality checks.
- Returns
  - If a `select` function is provided, the return value of the `select` function.
  - If no `select` function is provided, the `TAllParams` object or a loosened version of the `TAllParams` object if `opts.strict` is `false`.

#### `useLoaderData`

```tsx
  useLoaderData<TSelected = TLoaderData>(opts?: {
    select?: (search: TLoaderData) => TSelected
  }): TSelected
```

- A type-safe version of the `useLoaderData` hook that is pre-bound to the route ID that the `RouteApi` instance was created with.
- Options
  - `opts.select`
    - Optional
    - `(match: TLoaderData) => TSelected`
    - If supplied, this function will be called with the route match and the return value will be returned from `useLoaderData`. This value will also be used to determine if the hook should re-render its parent component using shallow equality checks.

#### `notFound`

```tsx
  notFound(notFoundError?: NotFoundError): NotFoundError
```

- A version of the `notFound` function that has its `routeId` option pre-bound to the route ID that the `RouteApi` instance was created with. This can be used to throw not-found errors on a specific route without having to specify the `routeId` option in `notFound`.
- See the [notFound function](./api/router/notFoundFunction) documentation for more information.
