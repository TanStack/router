title: Route Paths
---

Route `path`s are used to match parts of a URL's pathname to a route. At their core, route paths are just strings and can be defined using a variety of syntaxes, each with different behaviors. Before we get into those behaviors, lets look at a few important cross-cutting path concerns.

### Leading and Trailing Slashes

To make things extremely simple, route paths ignore leading and trailing slashes. You can include them if you want, but they do nothing 😜. The following are all valid paths:

- `/`
- `/about`
- `about/`
- `about`
- `$`
- `/$`
- `/$/`

### Inner Path Slashes

Inner path slashes are 100% valid and can be used to target paths without creating additional component hierarchy or markup.

For example, a path of `blog/post/edit` could be used to render a blog post editor without nesting it inside of other components:

```tsx
const rootConfig = new RootRoute()
const editRoute = new Route({ path: `blog/post/edit`, component: PostEditor })

const routeConfig = rootRoute.addChildren([editRoute])
```

This router setup would only render a single `<PostEditor />` component for the `blog/post/edit` path.

### Case-Sensitivity

Route paths are **not case-sensitive** by default. This means that `/about` and `/AbOuT` are considered the same path out-of-the box. This is a good thing, since this is the way most of the web works anyway! That said, if you truly want to be weird and match a path with a different case, you can set a route's `caseSensitive` property to `true`.

## Index Paths

A route with a path of `/` is called an "index" path because it specifically targets the state of a parent route when no child route is matched. This is best understood through an example:

```tsx
let rootRoute = new RootRoute()

// ✅ This is the index route for the entire router
// It will only display when the path is `/`
const indexRoute = new Route({ getParentRoute: () => rootRoute, path: '/' })

const blogRoute = new Route({ getParentRoute: () => rootRoute, path: 'blog' })

// ✅ This is the index route for the `/blog` route
// It will only display when the path is `/blog`
const blogIndexRoute = new Route({ getParentRoute: () => blogRoute, path: '/' })

const routeConfig = rootRoute.addChildren([
  indexRoute,
  blogRoute.addChildren([blogIndexRoute]),
])
```

If a route has any children, it is uncommon not to also have an index route. This is because the index route is the only way to render a component when the parent route is matched, but no child route is matched.

## Static Paths

Static paths are the simplest type of route path. They are just a string that matches the beginning of a URL's pathname. For example:

```tsx
let rootRoute = new RootRoute()

// ✅ This route will match any path that starts with `/about`
const aboutRoute = new Route({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: 'about',
})

const routeConfig = rootRoute.addChildren([aboutRoute])
```

## Dynamic Segments

A route path segment that starts with a `$` followed by a label is called a "dynamic segment" and captures that section of the URL into the `params` object for use in your application. For example:

```tsx
let rootRoute = new RootRoute()

const usersRoute = new Route({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: 'users',
})

// ✅ This path will capture anything in the path after `/users` and before the next slash
// eg. `/users/123` and `/users/123/details will both capture `123`
const userRoute = new Route({
  getParentRoute: () => usersRoute,
  path: '$userId',
})

const routeConfig = rootRoute.addChildren([usersRoute.addChildren([userRoute])])
```

Dynamic segments can be accessed via the `params` object using the label you provided as the property key. For example, a path of `/users/$userId` would produce a `userId` param of `123` for the path `/users/123/details`:

```tsx
{
  userId: '123'
}
```

## Splat / Catch-All Matching

A route with a path of only `*` or `$` is called a "splat" route because it _always_ captures _any_ remaining section of the URL from the `*`/`$` down. For example:

```tsx
let rootRoute = new RootRoute()

// This route will match any path that starts with `/file`
// For example, it will match both `/file` and `/file/documents/hello-world
const fileBaseRoute = new Route({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  path: 'file/*', // or `file/$`
})

const routeConfig = rootRoute.addChildren([fileBaseRoute])
```

Splat routes capture their matched path in the `params` object under the `*` property. For example, if the path is `/file/documents/hello-world`, the `params` object would look like this:

```js
{
  '*': 'documents/hello-world'
}
```

> 🧠 Why use both `*` and `$`? Thanks to tools like Remix, we know that while `*`s are the most common character to represent a wildcard/splat, they do not play nice with filenames or CLI tools. In those cases `$` can be a better choice.

## 404 / Non-matching Routes

A 404 / non-matching route is really just a fancy name for a [Splat / Catch-All](#splat-catch-all-matching) path. If no other routes match, the splat/catch-all route will always match

## Pathless Layout Routes

Pathless layout routes are routes that do not have a `path` and instead an `id` to uniquely identify them. Pathless layout routes do not use path segments from the URL pathname, nor do they add path segments to it during linking. They can be used to:

- Wrap child routes with a layout component
- Enforce an `loader` requirement before displaying any child routes
- Validate and provide search params to child routes
- Provide fallbacks for error components or pending elements to child routes
- Provide shared context to all child routes

To create a layout route, define a route with an `id` property instead of a `path`:

```tsx
const rootRoute = new Route()

// Our layout route
const layoutRoute = new Route({
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
  id: 'layout',
})

const layoutARoute = new Route({
  getParentRoute: () => layoutRoute,
  path: 'layout-a',
})

const layoutBRoute = new Route({
  getParentRoute: () => layoutRoute,
  path: 'layout-b',
})

const routeConfig = rootRoute.addChildren([
  layoutRoute.addChildren([layoutARoute, layoutBRoute]),
])
```

In the above example, the `layout` route will not add or match any path in the URL, but will wrap the `layout-a` and `layout-b` routes with any elements or logic defined in it.

> 🧠 An ID is required because every route must be uniquely identifiable, especially when using TypeScript so as to avoid type errors and accomplish autocomplete effectively.

## Identifying Routes via Search Params

Search Params by default are not used to identify matching paths mostly because they are extremely flexible, flat and can contain a lot of unrelated data to your actual route definition. However, in some cases you may choose to use them to uniquely identify a route match. For example, you may want to use a search param to identify a specific user in your application, you might model your url like this: `/user?userId=123`. This means that in your `user` route would need some extra help to identify a specific user. You can do this by adding a `getKey` function to your route:

```tsx
const userRoute = new Route({
  getParentRoute: () => usersRoute,
  path: 'user',
  getKey: ({ search }) => search.userId,
})
```

Route paths are just the beginning of what you can do with route configuration. We'll explore more of those features later on.
