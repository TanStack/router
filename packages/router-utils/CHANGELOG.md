# @tanstack/router-utils

## 1.162.1

### Patch Changes

- Add deferred Hydrate boundary support for TanStack Start. ([#7362](https://github.com/TanStack/router/pull/7362))

  Hydrate boundaries can now be code-split by the Start compiler, preload their generated client chunks, preserve server-rendered fallback HTML, and replay interaction-triggered events after hydration. The compiler integration now uses a Start-owned compiler plugin for Hydrate virtual modules across Vite and Rsbuild, with dev invalidation for generated virtual modules.

  Shared AST utilities used by the router code-splitter and Hydrate virtual modules were moved into `@tanstack/router-utils` so both pipelines can retain referenced top-level declarations, unwrap local exports, and let dead-code elimination remove unused route module code.
