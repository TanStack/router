# TanStack Router Core

TanStack Router is a type-safe router for React and Solid with built-in SWR caching, JSON-first search params, file-based route generation, and end-to-end type inference. The core is framework-agnostic; React and Solid bindings layer on top.

> **CRITICAL**: TanStack Router types are FULLY INFERRED. Never cast, never annotate inferred values. This is the #1 AI agent mistake.

> **CRITICAL**: TanStack Router is CLIENT-FIRST. Loaders run on the client by default, NOT server-only like Remix/Next.js. Do not confuse TanStack Router APIs with Next.js or React Router.

Use this entry skill to choose one primary sub-skill. Do not load the full catalog. Load a second sub-skill only when the task crosses a real boundary, such as an authenticated loader that needs both `auth-and-guards` and `data-loading`.

## Quick Decision Tree

```
Need to add/read/write URL query parameters?
  → router-core/search-params

Need dynamic URL segments like /posts/$postId?
  → router-core/path-params

Need to create links or navigate programmatically?
  → router-core/navigation

Need to fetch data for a route?
  Is it client-side only or client+server?
    → router-core/data-loading
  Using TanStack Query as external cache?
    → compositions/router-query (separate skill)

Need to protect routes behind auth?
  → router-core/auth-and-guards

Need to reduce bundle size per route?
  → router-core/code-splitting

Need custom 404 or error handling?
  → router-core/not-found-and-errors

Having TypeScript issues or performance problems?
  → router-core/type-safety

Need server-side rendering?
  → router-core/ssr
```

## Cross-Cutting Completion Checks

For route refactors:

1. Rename or move the route file; do not hand-edit the generated `createFileRoute` path.
2. Regenerate `routeTree.gen.ts` with the configured Router plugin or CLI.
3. Update links, redirects, `from` narrowing, params, and tests that reference the old route.
4. Run type tests and a production build. A typecheck alone does not prove route generation or bundling works.

For response schema changes:

1. Update the source model and shared validation schema.
2. Update the server function or API serializer so the field exists at runtime.
3. Update loader and component consumers without casts.
4. Assert the actual response payload in a unit or integration test. Typechecking cannot catch a serializer that omits the new field.

## Minimal Working Example

```tsx
// src/routes/__root.tsx
import { createRootRoute, Outlet } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createRootRoute({
  component: () => <Outlet />,
})
```

```tsx
// src/routes/index.tsx
import { createFileRoute } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const Route = createFileRoute('/')({
  component: () => <h1>Home</h1>,
})
```

```tsx
// src/router.tsx
import { createRouter } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { routeTree } from './routeTree.gen'

const router = createRouter({ routeTree })

// REQUIRED for type safety — without this, Link/useNavigate have no autocomplete
declare module '@tanstack/react-router' {
  interface Register {
    router: typeof router
  }
}

export default router
```

```tsx
// src/main.tsx
import { RouterProvider } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import router from './router'

function App() {
  return <RouterProvider router={router} />
}
```

## Common Mistakes

### HIGH: createFileRoute path string must match the file path

The Vite plugin manages the path string in `createFileRoute`. Do not change it manually — it must match the file's location under `src/routes/`:

```tsx
// File: src/routes/posts/$postId.tsx
export const Route = createFileRoute('/posts/$postId')({
  // ✅ matches file path
  component: PostPage,
})

export const Route = createFileRoute('/post/$postId')({
  // ❌ silent mismatch
  component: PostPage,
})
```

The plugin auto-generates this string. If you rename a route file, the plugin updates it. Never edit the path string by hand.

## Version Note

This skill targets `@tanstack/router-core` v1.171.15. Splat routes use `$` (not `*`); the `*` compat alias will be removed in v2.
