# TanStack Router - Angular Basic File-based Example

This example showcases **file-based route generation** for Angular using `@tanstack/angular-router-experimental` and `@tanstack/router-plugin` with Vite, aligned with the React basic-file-based example.

## What's demonstrated

- **Target: Angular** – The router generator is configured with `target: 'angular'` so route files use Angular standalone components and `@tanstack/angular-router-experimental'`.
- **Autogenerated route files** – Adding new files under `src/routes/` (e.g. `__root.ts`, `index.ts`, `about.ts`, `posts.route.ts`) and running the dev server or generator will scaffold Angular components and route definitions.
- **Generated route tree** – `src/routeTree.gen.ts` is produced by the plugin and wired into the app router.

## Setup

From the repo root:

```bash
pnpm install
cd examples/angular/basic-file-based
pnpm dev
```

Open http://localhost:3001.

## Project structure

- `src/routes/` – File-based routes. The generator creates/updates files here.
- `src/routeTree.gen.ts` – Generated route tree (do not edit by hand).
- `src/router.ts` – Router instance using the generated `routeTree`.
- `vite.config.ts` – Plugin config: `tanstackRouter({ target: 'angular', ... })`.

## Adding new routes

1. Add a new file under `src/routes/`, e.g. `src/routes/contact.ts`.
2. Run `pnpm dev` (or `pnpm generate`). The plugin will scaffold the route file with an Angular component and `createFileRoute(...)`.
3. The route tree is updated automatically; navigate to `/contact`.

## Generating routes manually

```bash
pnpm generate
```

This runs the TanStack Router generator (e.g. via `tsr generate` if the CLI is installed) and updates route files and `routeTree.gen.ts`.
