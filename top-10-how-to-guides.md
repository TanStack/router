## Implementation Notes

### For Each Guide:

1. **Start with a working example** - Provide complete, copy-paste ready code
2. **Include common variations** - Cover different frameworks (React/Solid), bundlers, etc.
3. **Add troubleshooting section** - Address the most common issues
4. **Link to related guides** - Create a connected documentation experience
5. **Include next steps** - Point to related advanced topics

### AI/Developer Productivity Focus:

- Each guide should be **scannable** - use clear headings and bullet points
- Include **minimal working examples** that can be quickly copied
- Provide **error message → solution** mappings for common issues
- Use **consistent patterns** across guides for predictability

### Priority Implementation Order:

1. Start with **deployment guide** (#1) - highest GitHub issue frequency
2. Follow with **SSR setup** (#2) - complex but high-impact
3. **Migration guide** (#3) - large user base need
4. Continue in priority order based on issue frequency and impact

These guides would significantly reduce the most common support requests and improve both developer and AI assistant effectiveness when working with TanStack Router.
