## Implementation Process

### For Each New How-To Guide:

1. **Create the guide** in `docs/router/framework/react/how-to/[guide-name].md`
2. **Follow the established structure:**
   - Quick Start section
   - Step-by-step platform/scenario-specific instructions
   - Production checklist (if applicable)
   - Common Problems section
   - Common Next Steps (commented out until guides exist)
   - Related Resources (specific links only)
3. **Update the directory README** to list the new guide
4. **Update this tracking document** to mark as completed
5. **Uncomment relevant "Common Next Steps"** in other guides that reference this one

### Multi-PR Guidelines:

- **One guide per PR** for focused reviews and easier iteration
- **Start with highest priority** guides (#4, #5, #6...)
- **Cross-reference between guides** as they become available
- **Update tracking status** in each PR

- Fixing TypeScript route generation
- Resolving import/export errors
- Optimizing bundle size
- Common Problems: Type generation failures, build optimization, module resolution

---

### Priority 2: Guide #5 - How to Integrate with Popular UI Libraries

**File:** `docs/router/framework/react/how-to/integrate-ui-libraries.md`

**Context for Agent:**

- GitHub Issue #939 shows Shadcn/ui animation conflicts
- Focus on most popular libraries with known integration challenges

**Content Requirements:**

- Shadcn/ui integration and animation fixes
- Material-UI/MUI setup
- Chakra UI integration

- Create practical, step-by-step version focused on implementation
- Include popular auth provider integrations

**Content Requirements:**

- Setting up route context for auth
- Creating auth-protected route patterns
- Implementing login redirects
- Handling auth state persistence
- Integration with popular auth providers (Auth0, Clerk, Supabase)

### Remaining Guides (Priority 6-11):

**Priority 6:** Debug Common Router Issues (`debug-router-issues.md`)
**Priority 7:** Set Up Testing (`setup-testing.md`)  
**Priority 8:** Set Up Development Environment (`setup-dev-environment.md`)
**Priority 9:** Handle Search Parameters and URL State (`handle-search-parameters.md`)
**Priority 10:** Implement Advanced Routing Patterns (`advanced-routing-patterns.md`)

---

## Agent Instructions Template

When implementing each guide, use this template for your agent task:

```
Create a comprehensive how-to guide for [GUIDE_TITLE] following the established pattern:

1. **Read the priority document** at how-to-guides-implementation-plan.md for context
2. **Check existing documentation** mentioned in the Context section
3. **Follow the structure** from deploy-to-production.md:
   - Quick Start
   - Platform/scenario-specific instructions
   - Production checklist (if applicable)
   - Common Problems
   - Common Next Steps (commented out)
   - Related Resources (specific only)
4. **Update the README** at docs/router/framework/react/how-to/README.md
5. **Update tracking** in how-to-guides-implementation-plan.md
6. **Cross-reference existing guides** by uncommenting relevant "Common Next Steps"

Focus on practical, copy-paste ready solutions that solve real developer pain points.
```
