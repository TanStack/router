# How-To Guides Implementation Plan

This document outlines the multi-PR process for implementing the remaining how-to guides for TanStack Router.

## Progress Tracking

- ✅ **Guide #1: Deploy to Production** - COMPLETED in docs/router/framework/react/how-to/deploy-to-production.md
- ✅ **Guide #2: Setup SSR** - COMPLETED in docs/router/framework/react/how-to/setup-ssr.md
- ✅ **Guide #3: Migrate from React Router v7** - COMPLETED in docs/router/framework/react/how-to/migrate-from-react-router.md
- ⏳ **Guides #4-11** - Pending implementation

## Implementation Process

### For Each New How-To Guide:

1. **Create the guide** in `docs/router/framework/react/how-to/[guide-name].md`
2. **Follow the established structure:**
   - Quick Start section
   - Step-by-step platform/scenario-specific instructions
   - Production checklist (if applicable)
   - Common Problems section
   - Common Next Steps (commented out until guides exist)
   - Related Resources (specific links only)
3. **Update the directory README** to list the new guide
4. **Update this tracking document** to mark as completed
5. **Uncomment relevant "Common Next Steps"** in other guides that reference this one

### Multi-PR Guidelines:

- **One guide per PR** for focused reviews and easier iteration
- **Start with highest priority** guides (#4, #5, #6...)
- **Cross-reference between guides** as they become available
- **Update tracking status** in each PR

## Agent Instructions Template

When implementing each guide, use this template for your agent task:

```
Create a comprehensive how-to guide for [GUIDE_TITLE] following the established pattern:

1. **Read the priority document** at how-to-guides-implementation-plan.md for context
2. **Check existing documentation** mentioned in the Context section
3. **Follow the structure** from deploy-to-production.md:
   - Quick Start
   - Platform/scenario-specific instructions
   - Production checklist (if applicable)
   - Common Problems
   - Common Next Steps (commented out)
   - Related Resources (specific only)
4. **Update the README** at docs/router/framework/react/how-to/README.md
5. **Update tracking** in how-to-guides-implementation-plan.md
6. **Cross-reference existing guides** by uncommenting relevant "Common Next Steps"

Focus on practical, copy-paste ready solutions that solve real developer pain points.
```
