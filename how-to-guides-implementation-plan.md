## Implementation Process

### For Each New How-To Guide:

1. **Create the guide** in `docs/router/framework/react/how-to/[guide-name].md`
2. **Follow the established structure:**
   - Quick Start section
   - Step-by-step platform/scenario-specific instructions
   - Production checklist (if applicable)
   - Common Problems section
   - Common Next Steps (commented out until guides exist)
   - Related Resources (specific links only)
3. **Create or verify test coverage** for documented patterns (see Test Verification section below)
4. **Update the directory README** to list the new guide
5. **Update this tracking document** to mark as completed
6. **Uncomment relevant "Common Next Steps"** in other guides that reference this one

### Multi-PR Guidelines:

- **One guide per PR** for focused reviews and easier iteration
- **Start with highest priority** guides (#4, #5, #6...)
- **Cross-reference between guides** as they become available
- **Update tracking status** in each PR

### Test Verification Requirements:

**CRITICAL:** Each how-to guide MUST be backed by working tests that verify the documented patterns actually work.

**Test Strategy:**
1. **Check existing test coverage first** - If patterns are already tested in `packages/*/tests/`, reference those tests
2. **Create focused unit tests** for undocumented patterns using the existing test structure
3. **Place tests in** `packages/react-router/tests/how-to-[guide-name].test.tsx`
4. **Follow existing test patterns** from `searchMiddleware.test.tsx`, `link.test.tsx`, etc.
5. **Test the exact code examples** shown in the guide to ensure they work

**Test Coverage Analysis:**
- ‚úÖ **Good Coverage:** Schema validation (Zod tests), middleware (`searchMiddleware.test.tsx`), basic navigation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Partial Coverage:** Route inheritance patterns, debug scenarios
- ‚ùå **Missing Coverage:** Complex types (arrays/objects/dates), performance patterns, custom serialization, filtering systems, form integration, loader integration

**Test Requirements by Guide:**
- **Search #1 (Basic):** Create `how-to-basic-search-params.test.tsx` - Test basic `validateSearch` patterns, `useSearch()` hook
- **Search #2 (Navigation):** Create `how-to-navigate-search-params.test.tsx` - Test `<Link search />`, functional updates, `navigate()`
- **Search #3 (Validation):** Reference existing Zod adapter tests, add guide-specific examples if needed
- **Search #4 (Complex Types):** Create `how-to-complex-search-types.test.tsx` - Test arrays, objects, dates, enums
- **Search #5 (Cross-route):** Extend existing middleware tests with route inheritance patterns
- **Search #6 (Middleware):** Reference existing `searchMiddleware.test.tsx`, add advanced patterns
- **Search #7 (Performance):** Create `how-to-search-performance.test.tsx` - Test selectors, re-render optimization
- **Search #8 (Serialization):** Create `how-to-search-serialization.test.tsx` - Test custom parsers/serializers
- **Search #9 (Filtering):** Create `how-to-search-filtering.test.tsx` - Test complex filter combinations
- **Search #10 (Forms):** Create `how-to-search-forms.test.tsx` - Test form state synchronization
- **Search #11 (Debug):** Extend existing debug tests with guide-specific scenarios
- **Search #12 (Data Loading):** Create `how-to-search-loaders.test.tsx` - Test search params in loaders

**Test Development Process:**
1. **Write the guide first** with complete code examples
2. **Create corresponding tests** that verify every code example works
3. **Run tests** to ensure all examples are correct
4. **Fix any issues** in both guide and tests
5. **Document test file location** in the guide's "Testing" section

## Agent Instructions Template

When implementing each guide, use this template for your agent task:

```
Create a comprehensive how-to guide for [GUIDE_TITLE] following the established pattern:

1. **Read the priority document** at how-to-guides-implementation-plan.md for context
2. **Check existing documentation** mentioned in the Context section
3. **Follow the structure** from deploy-to-production.md:
   - Quick Start
   - Platform/scenario-specific instructions
   - Production checklist (if applicable)
   - Common Problems
   - Common Next Steps (commented out)
   - Related Resources (specific only)
4. **Update the README** at docs/router/framework/react/how-to/README.md
5. **Update tracking** in how-to-guides-implementation-plan.md
6. **Cross-reference existing guides** by uncommenting relevant "Common Next Steps"

Focus on practical, copy-paste ready solutions that solve real developer pain points.
```
