# Migration Guide Implementation Summary

## What Was Accomplished

Successfully implemented **Guide #3: How to Migrate from React Router v6** as the next highest priority how-to guide (excluding setup-ssr which is being handled async).

### Files Created/Updated

1. **Created comprehensive migration guide**: `docs/router/framework/react/how-to/migrate-from-react-router.md`
   - Complete step-by-step migration process (8 detailed steps)
   - Production checklist with testing guidance
   - Common problems section with solutions
   - Cross-references to related documentation

2. **Updated project documentation**:
   - Added guide to `docs/router/framework/react/how-to/README.md`
   - Updated tracking in `how-to-guides-implementation-plan.md`
   - Added cross-reference from `deploy-to-production.md`

### Guide Features

The migration guide follows the established pattern and includes:

- **Quick Start section** - Time requirements, difficulty, prerequisites
- **8-step detailed process** - From preparation to type safety
- **Production checklist** - Router config, migration, navigation, cleanup, testing
- **Common Problems** - 6 major issues with detailed solutions
- **Common Next Steps** - Advanced features to explore (commented until guides exist)
- **Related Resources** - Specific links to relevant documentation

### Content Quality

- **Copy-paste ready code examples** for all migration steps
- **Before/after comparisons** showing React Router v6 vs TanStack Router syntax
- **Real-world scenarios** covering nested routes, dynamic params, search params
- **TypeScript integration** with type safety guidance
- **Troubleshooting focus** addressing actual migration pain points

## Next Priority Guidelines

Based on the top-10 how-to guides priority list, the next highest priorities should be:

1. **Guide #4: How to Fix Common Build and Bundler Issues** (if SSR guide still in progress)
2. **Guide #5: How to Integrate with Popular UI Libraries** 
3. **Guide #6: How to Set Up Authentication and Protected Routes**

### Implementation Notes

- Each guide should follow the established pattern from deploy-to-production.md
- Cross-reference between guides as they become available
- Focus on practical, copy-paste ready solutions
- Address real GitHub issues and pain points mentioned in the priority analysis

## Impact

This migration guide addresses:
- **High priority user need** - Large React Router v6 user base requiring migration
- **Real developer pain points** - API differences, breaking changes, component refactoring
- **Productivity improvement** - Reduces migration friction from hours/days to 2-4 hours
- **Type safety benefits** - Guides users to TanStack Router's superior TypeScript experience

The guide is positioned to significantly reduce migration support requests and improve developer adoption of TanStack Router.
